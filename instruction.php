         <strong> INSTRUCTIONS FOR MARRIAGE:</strong></h3>
		  <p"> 

<p>
In Section 70 of the National Civil (Code) Act, 2017 (2074), it has been stated that a marriage may be concluded between a man and a woman if the following conditions are met:
<br><br>
1. If the man and the woman agree to accept each other as husband and wife,<br>
2. If the man and the woman are not relatives, punishable by law, incest,<br>
3. If a matrimonial relationship of both the man and the woman does not exist (Unmarried, Divorced, Widowed),<br>
4. If both have attained twenty years of age.<br><br>
For those whose culture or community accepts marriage between relatives, the law allows marriage among those people.
